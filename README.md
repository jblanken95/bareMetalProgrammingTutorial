**Purpose**

This repo is to hold and track progress following the tutorials provided by lowbyteproductions in the Bare Metal Programming tutorial. 


**Context**

In this tutorial, I am using the STM32F303VCT6 microcontroller discovery board. I am avoiding reliance on provided libraries as much as possible and the use of the STM32 Cube IDE. Development will be done in C using the VS Code environemnt. Projects will include:

  - Blinky "Hello World"
  - Simple UART driver
  - UART driver with ring buffer
  - At some point, a simple bootloader

**TODO**
